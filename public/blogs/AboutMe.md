## Hey I'm Variant!


A note[^1]

A second note [^2]

### Heading 3[^3]

So let this be my first test blog for your website.
I hope this is rendered as I suppose it to be. 

I hope the **bold** and _italics_ work as intended & 
the <mark>line</mark> breaks work the same as well

I hope that
```js
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
  import Markdown from 'react-markdown'
  import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

  console.log("Hello World");
```

```html
<div class="flex ...">
  <div class="flex-none w-14 ...">
    01
  </div>
  <div class="flex-auto w-64 ...">
    02
  </div>
  <div class="flex-auto w-32 ...">
    03
  </div>
</div>
```
works as well


I hope that latex is rendered beautifully as well, for all the equations that you will be writing as you go on to educate the world about your work, just like $E = mc^2$

$$\frac{10}{4x} \approx 2^{12}$$
$$ \lambda _{max} = \frac{b}{T} $$

b : constant of proportionality <br/>
$\lambda _{max}$ : peak wavelength <br/>
T : temperature


Let's see if the list works the way as it is supposed to.
So let's create a list of your favourite tv shows in order.
1. How I Met Your Mother
2. Doctor Who
3. Gravity Falls
4. Rocket Boys(?)
   1. !["Rocket Boys Poster"](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/wmL9EfxrRI7pt8kPMO0f62FiGgr.jpg "Rocket Boys")
5. Loki
